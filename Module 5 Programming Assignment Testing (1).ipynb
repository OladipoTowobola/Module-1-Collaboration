    "The purpose of this assignment is to practice and apply the concepts of software testing learned in this chapter, \n",
    "with a specific focus on unit testing. In this assignment, I navigated to the \"Getting Started with Testing\" \n",
    "resource and completed the required sections: Testing Your Code, Writing \n",
    "your First Test, and Executing Your First Test.\n",
    "Using Jupyter Notebook, I implemented unit tests to verify that my code functions correctly \n",
    "and produces the expected results. This process involved creating test cases, writing test functions, \n",
    "and running the tests to validate program behavior. Through this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in identifying errors, \n",
    "improving code reliability, and understanding the importance of automated testing in software development.\n",

    "The test results provide a summary of the code's reliability. When you execute these tests, the output typically shows a series of symbols: a dot (.) represents a passed test, while an F represents a failure.The Passed Test (test_list_int): This confirms that when the input is [1, 2, 3], the function correctly returns 6. It validates that the basic logic of the loop and addition is sound for integers.The Failed Test (test_list_fraction): In this exercise, the test for fractions is expected to fail because 1/4 + 1/4 + 2/5 actually equals 9/10 (or 0.9), not 1. The AssertionError tells us exactly what went wrong: it shows the \"Expected\" value versus the \"Actual\" value.In summary: These results mean that our code works for simple integers but helps us catch logical errors (like expecting a specific sum from fractions) before the code is deployed. It acts as a safety net for future changes."
